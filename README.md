# Hello-World
This my first repository and also my first time working on GitHub.
My name is Rahul, i live in india. I don't want to give more info away :p.

Hi once again!
So, this time I'll be adding some info on the way github works, rather more so on the terminology, as that's something I always forget. 

Branch -> essentially, quite literally a branch, wherein one works on a copy of the 'master' branch, edits it without affecting the master. 

Commit -> Simply saving one's changes to the branch one's working on. This is different from a pull request. Here we're just saving changes to the branch we're working on, and thereby not affecting the master branch, unless we're working on that itself. 

Pull Request -> When we want to 'merge' our changes with the master, i.e. incorporate whatever we've done on the non-master branch into the master branch, we submit a pull request. 

We accept a pull request by merging changes, wherein we first review changes called diffs (for differences) and then confirm that we want to merge them. We can/should (not sure if this is optional as I didn't try it out) also delete the branch once we've merged it with the master. 

Something I'm unclear about right now: 
Github Guides' 'Hello World' tutorial had this line about pull requests:
"As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished."
Src: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
My question being, how does one open a pull request without even finishing the code, or rather, how does doing that make sense and does it have any practical applications?
Perhaps the play is on the word 'can' wherein one can open a pull req. without finishing the code, but one usually doesn't. 

Bye for now!
